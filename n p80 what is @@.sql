From the MSDN Transact-SQL Variables article: 
The names of some Transact-SQL system functions begin with two
 at signs (@@). Although in earlier versions of Microsoft SQL Server,
  the @@functions are referred to as global variables, 
  they are not variables 
and do not have the same behaviors as variables
